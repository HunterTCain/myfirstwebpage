  <p> Downtown Boise is an awesome place because this is where a lot of my life happens.
      Some of my favorite things about this place is:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>The STIL</li> 
        <p>This is where I work and scoop ice cream.</p> 
        <p>Here is their <a href="http://www.ilovethestil.com/"> Website</a></p>
      <li>PROST!</li>
        <p>This is the best spot in Boise to grab a beer. 
          It,s right in the heart of 8th Street and has the best brews around.
          My friends and I meet here every Wednesday night.</p>
